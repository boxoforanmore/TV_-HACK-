[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/boxoforanmore/TV_-HACK-.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/boxoforanmore/TV_-HACK-)

This is a very dumb and simple shell script that started as an example of what hacking on TV looks like, then it changed to be about Shrek

So, there's at least at that...

Run with `./hacking.sh`

(Or just look at the Travis build)

You should also probably exit with CTRL^C once you get to the very end (You'll know when)

(The sleep is very long)
